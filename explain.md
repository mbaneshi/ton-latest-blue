Let's break down the provided TypeScript code step-by-step, paying close attention to the imports from `@ton/core`.

**Overall Purpose of the Code:**

This code snippet is designed to interact with a deployed smart contract called `WeeklyWinner` on the TON (The Open Network) blockchain. It allows a user to send a message to the contract to increment an internal counter. The script waits for the counter to update on the blockchain and then confirms the successful increment.

**Line-by-Line Explanation:**

```typescript
import { Address, toNano } from '@ton/core';
import { WeeklyWinner } from '../wrappers/WeeklyWinner';
import { NetworkProvider, sleep } from '@ton/blueprint';
```

- **`import { Address, toNano } from '@ton/core';`**: This is the line we'll delve into deeply. It imports specific objects from the `@ton/core` library. \* **`@ton/core`**: This is a fundamental library in the TON ecosystem. It provides core data structures, utility functions, and low-level tools for interacting with the TON blockchain.

    - **`Address`**:

        - **Purpose:** Represents an address on the TON blockchain. Addresses are unique identifiers for accounts, including smart contracts and regular user wallets.
        - **Type:** In TypeScript, `Address` is likely a class or an interface defined within the `@ton/core` library. It encapsulates the underlying representation of a TON address (which is typically a 34-byte value).
        - **Functionality:** The `Address` object provides methods for:
            - **Parsing:** Converting string representations of addresses into `Address` objects (e.g., using `Address.parse()`). This allows you to work with user-friendly address formats.
            - **Serialization:** Converting `Address` objects back into string representations.
            - **Comparison:** Comparing two `Address` objects to see if they are the same.
            - **Accessing underlying data:** Potentially accessing the raw byte representation of the address if needed for more advanced operations.
        - **Use Cases:**
            - Identifying the recipient of a transaction.
            - Specifying the address of a smart contract you want to interact with.
            - Storing account identifiers in your application's state.

    - **`toNano`**:
        - **Purpose:** A utility function for converting a human-readable amount of TON cryptocurrency into its smallest unit, called "nanoton". 1 TON is equal to 1,000,000,000 (10^9) nanoton.
        - **Type:** It's a function that likely accepts a string or a number as input and returns a `BigInt`. `BigInt` is a built-in JavaScript type for representing arbitrarily large integers, necessary because nanoton amounts can exceed the limits of standard JavaScript numbers.
        - **Functionality:** It performs the multiplication by 10^9. This is essential because all transaction values and contract balances on the TON blockchain are represented in nanoton.
        - **Use Cases:**
            - Specifying the amount of TON to send in a transacs and utilities for building and deploying TON smart contracts, often used in development and testing environments.
    - **`NetworkProvider`**: An interface or class that represents a connection texport`\*\*: Makes this function available to be called from other modules or scripts.
        - **`async`**: Indicates that the function can perform asynchronous operations (like waiting for blockchain interactions).
        - **`provider: NetworkProvider`**: The function accepts a `NetworkProvider` object as an argument. This object will be used to interact with the TON network.
        - \*\*`args: stri This is a ternary operator.
            - If there are command-line arguments (`args.length > 0`), it takes the first argument (`args[0]`) as the address.
            - Otherwise, it prompts the user to enter the address using `await ui.input('WeeklyWinner address')`.
        - **`Address.parse(...)`**: The input (either from arguments or user input) is assumed to be a string representation of a TON akProvider` to query the blockchain and see if a contract exists at the specified address. This is anaddress)`\*\*: This is likely a static method on the `WeeklyWinner` class that takes an `Address` object as input and creates a `WeeklyWinner` instance associated with that address.
        - **`provider.open(...)`**: The `provider.open()` method is used to associate the wrapper instance with the network provider, allowing it to send messages and query state. await weeklyWinner.getCounter();

    ```                                                                                                                                                                           **`provider.sender()`**:  Gets the default sender account from the `NetworkProvider`. This is typically the account that will pay for the transaction fees.

    - **`{ value: toNano('0.05') }`**: This is the message configuration.
        - **`value: toNano('0.05')`**: Specifies the amount of TON to attach to the message. `toNano('0.05')`con value: toNano('0.05'g sent to the contract. This likely corresponds to a function or internal receiver in the`WeeklyWinner` contract named "Add".
        - **`queryId: 0n`**: A unique identifier for the message (often used for tracking responses).
        - \*\*`amoue updated on the blockchain. \* It enteite('Counter increased successfully!')`: Displays a success message to the user.

**In Summary:**
the operation.

The code interacts with a `WeeklyWinner` smart contract to increment a counter. It utilizes the `Address` object to represent the contract's address and the `toNano` function to convert TON amounts into nanoton for the transaction. The `NetworkProvider` is used to connect to the blockchain and send the "Add" message. The code then waits for the counter to update on the blockchain before confirming alue again from the contract.

```typescript
    ui.clearActionPrompt();
    ui.write('Counter increased successfully!');
}
```

- Once the `while` loop exits (meaning `counterAfter` is different from `counterBefore`), the counter has been successfully updated.
    - `ui.clearActionPrompt()`: Clears the action prompt from the UI.
    - `ui.wrrs a `while`loop that continues as long as the`counterAfter`value is the same as the`counterBefore` value.
    - Inside the loop:
        - `ui.setActionPrompt(...)`: Displays a message to the user indicating the current attempt number.
        - `await sleep(2000)`: Pauses the execution for 2 seconds.
        - `counterAfter = await weeklyWinner.getCounter();`: Fetches the current counter v}

- **`await weeklyWinner.send(...)`**: This is the core interaction with the smart contract. It sends a message to the `WeeklyWinner` contract.
  \*generated by the contract's tooling based on the contract's ABI.

*   **`const                            counterBefore = await weeklyWinner.getCounter();`**: This line calls a method on the `weeklyWinner` object (the wrapper) to get the current value of the `counter` state variable in the smart contract. `getCounter()` is likely a method automatically

```typescript
    const counterBefore = yed, and the function returns.

```typescript
    const weeklyWinner = provider.open(WeeklyWinner.fromAddress(address));

- **`const weeklyWinner = provider.open(WeeklyWinner.fromAddress(address));`**: This line creates an instance of the `WeeklyWinner` wrapper class to interact with the deployed contract.
    - \*\*`WeeklyWinner.fromAddress( asynchronous operation, hence the `await`.
    - **`!`**: Negates the result.
    - If the contract is _not_ deployed, an error message is displaeployed(address)`**: Calls a method on the `Networddress. The `Address.parse()` method (from the `@ton/core` import) converts this string into an `Address` object.

```typescript
if (!(await provider.isContractDeployed(address))) {
    ui.write(`Error: Contract at address ${address} is not deployed!`);
    return;
}
```

- **`if (!(await provider.isContractDeployed(address)))`**: This checks if a smart contract is deployed at the given `address`.
    - **`provider.isContractDgs[0] : await ui.input('WeeklyWinner address')`**: to the user (e.g., using `ui.write()`) and getting input (e.g., using `ui.input()`).

```typescript
const address = Address.parse(args.length > 0 ? args[0] : await ui.input('WeeklyWinner address'));
```

- **`const address = Address.parse(...)`**: This line retrieves the address of the `WeeklyWinner` contract.
    - **`args.length > 0 ? arng[]`**: The function also accepts an array of strings as arguments. These are typically command-line arguments passed to the script.

```typescript
const ui = provider.ui();
```

- **`const ui = provider.ui();`**: Accesses a user interface object from the `NetworkProvider`. This `ui` object likely provides methods for displaying information
