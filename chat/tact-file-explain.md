Okay, let's break down this Tact smart contract file step-by-step.

**Overall Structure**

This code defines a smart contract called `WeeklyWinner` using the Tact programming language, which is designed for developing smart contracts on the TON blockchain. It's a relatively simple example, but demonstrates key concepts.

**1. Import Statement:**

```tact
import "@stdlib/deploy";
```

- **`import "@stdlib/deploy";`**: This line imports the `deploy` module from the Tact standard library (`@stdlib`). The `deploy` module likely provides necessary tools and functions for making a contract deployable to the TON blockchain. Specifically, `Deployable` interface (see later in the code) is defined in this module.

**2. Message Definition:**

```tact
message Add {
    queryId: Int as uint64;
    amount: Int as uint32;
}
```

- **`message Add { ... }`**: This defines a message type called `Add`. Messages are how external actors (like users or other contracts) interact with this smart contract.
    - **`queryId: Int as uint64;`**: This declares a field named `queryId` of type `Int` (integer), specifically represented as an unsigned 64-bit integer (`uint64`). It's commonly used as an identifier for a specific request, especially when expecting a response.
    - **`amount: Int as uint32;`**: This declares another field `amount`, of type `Int` represented as an unsigned 32-bit integer (`uint32`). This likely represents the amount to be added in a specific context.

**3. Contract Definition:**

```tact
contract WeeklyWinner with Deployable {
    id: Int as uint32;
    counter: Int as uint32;

    init(id: Int) {
        self.id = id;
        self.counter = 0;
    }

    receive(msg: Add) {
        self.counter += msg.amount;

        // Notify the caller that the receiver was executed and forward remaining value back
        self.notify("Cashback".asComment());
    }

    get fun counter(): Int {
        return self.counter;
    }

    get fun id(): Int {
        return self.id;
    }
}
```

- **`contract WeeklyWinner with Deployable { ... }`**: This declares the main smart contract named `WeeklyWinner`.

    - **`with Deployable`**: This part specifies that the `WeeklyWinner` contract implements the `Deployable` interface (which was imported earlier). Implementing `Deployable` is likely necessary to allow the contract to be deployed and managed on the TON blockchain.

- **State Variables:**

    - **`id: Int as uint32;`**: This declares a state variable called `id` of type `Int` (integer), specifically as an unsigned 32-bit integer (`uint32`). State variables persist within the contract across transactions. Likely it would identify the contract instance.
    - **`counter: Int as uint32;`**: This declares a state variable called `counter` also of type `Int` (unsigned 32-bit integer - `uint32`). This will probably be used to track a count within the contract.

- **`init(id: Int) { ... }`**: This is the initialization function of the contract.

    - **`self.id = id;`**: Sets the `id` state variable to the value passed to the function when contract is created.
    - **`self.counter = 0;`**: Initializes the `counter` state variable to `0`. This function is executed only once when the contract is deployed.

- **`receive(msg: Add) { ... }`**: This is the main function that processes messages of type `Add` sent to the contract.

    - **`self.counter += msg.amount;`**: Increments the `counter` state variable by the `amount` received in the `msg` of the type `Add`.
    - **`self.notify("Cashback".asComment());`**: This line sends a notification back to the caller of the message, using "Cashback" as a comment. This is likely used to acknowledge message execution with additional info and returning a remaining value.

- **Getter Functions:**
    - **`get fun counter(): Int { return self.counter; }`**: This defines a read-only function `counter` which returns the current value of the `counter` state variable. `get` indicates it's a view function (doesn't modify contract state).
    - **`get fun id(): Int { return self.id; }`**: This defines a read-only function `id` which returns the current value of the `id` state variable.

**In Summary**

This Tact contract, `WeeklyWinner`, is designed to:

1.  **Be deployed:** By implementing `Deployable`, it can be deployed on the TON blockchain.
2.  **Have an ID:** It's initialized with an identifier (`id`).
3.  **Accept "Add" messages:** Users can send messages of type `Add`, providing a `queryId` and an `amount`.
4.  **Track a counter:** When an `Add` message is received, the contract adds the provided amount to the internal `counter`.
5.  **Notify after processing:** It returns a notification after processing a message, along with possibly remaining value.
6.  **Expose `counter` and `id`:** Provides read-only functions `counter()` and `id()` to retrieve the stored values.

**Potential Use Case**

This example is somewhat basic, but it could be a starting point for a more complex system. For example, this contract could be used as a simple counter, or as part of a system to track participation points in weekly event. It's also similar to a token contract with no token balances but rather having one shared counter.
